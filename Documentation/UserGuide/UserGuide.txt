ATD User Guide

ATD depends on Docker and python 2.7. Installation of Docker is beyond the scope of this guide. Please refer to the Docker online documentation for installation instructions for your platform.


At first, the user should create a config file which includes some parameters as follows (provided information is used as an example):
1. distro= wheezy
[wheezy] is the version of operating system that is being used by the user

2. apt_dependencies= bash sudo cron vim git python2.7 python-pip sqlite3 ca-certificates  python-sqlite
The dependencies for apt-get on debian based distros.

3. repository_url= https://github.com/visgence/teleceptor.git
[URL] defines the url address of repository which contains the source code

4. unit_test_path= /teleceptor/unittests/
[PATH] refers to the path of unit tests, relative to the repository's directory structure

5. email_address= test@test.com
[Email] defines the email address of user

There are some other optional parameters which should be filled as follows:
1. test_commands= python functionalTest.py, python stressTest.py, python FailTest.py
The commands that run the project's tests in the unit_test_path.

2. pip_dependencies = sqlalchemy cherrypy requests whisper pySerial jinja2
Python package dependencies to install with pip.

3. branch_name = atdtest
Branch of the git repo.


The config file should be placed in the directory that ATD is called from, e.g. src/ATD.


To run ATD, simply run the dockerController.py file from the ATD directory, i.e.:
    python DockerController/dockerController.py

dockerController.py will read in the config file from the ATD directory and automatically begin creating the necessary Docker containers to run the tests in.
	Once the tests are finished, a report of the passed and failed tests will be output to the user, and, if any tests failed, an email will be sent to the provided email address.

The user may run dockerController.py as a cron job. No user input is required during ATD, but the user may wish to redirect the output to a log file. Installing ATD as a cron job is beyond the scope of this document. Please refer to online sources, such as https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto
